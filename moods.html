So let me be that gentleness for you — even for a moment.

If your heart feels a little dull today… here's a tiny reminder: you are someone's favorite human.
(That someone is me, obviously.)
But just in case you forgot why your smile is one of my favorite things in the whole world… let me remind you: 
- Your smile can turn my worst day around.
•Because you're amazing.
•Because you've made so many people happy — especially me.

Now go look in the mirror and give yourself the softest, tiniest smile — and if that feels hard, just imagine me saying: Buggu aaj aap bahut Cute lg rhe h ek kissi de de aapko.
And don't forget to send me your snap when you smile😚`,

Who made my favorite human mad, hmm? Do I need to roll up my sleeves and go full filmy revenge mode? 
Because you know I will.

Something or someone has clearly tested your patience — and maybe you’re clenching your jaw, overthinking, or just done with everything.

 I hope you never forget — even in your angriest storms — you are still loved. So much. So fully. So deeply.

Even when your words are sharp.
Even when you go quiet.
Even when your heart is too full to speak.

This letter isn’t here to fix things — just to sit beside your fire, silently saying:
I see you. I hear you. I’m with you.
And when you're ready to talk — even if you just want to yell while I listen — text me. Call me. Don’t look at the time. I’m always here🤗"`,

I don't like knowing that you're sad.
Not because I expect you to always be happy — but because I care so much that your pain feels like mine too.

I wish I could reach through this note and just pull you into a big, warm hug right now.
Because sadness is heavy, and you shouldn't have to carry it all by yourself.

Some days your heart just hurts —
Without warning. Without reason.
And you wonder if you're too much, or not enough, or maybe just lost in between.

And I want you to remember this:
You are not alone. Not now. Not ever.
You're loved. You're needed. You're held — even from a distance.

Take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.No matter what time it is — late, early, or in between — just call or text me. I'll pick up. Always"`,

If you're opening this, it means life feels a little heavy right now. Maybe you're tired. Maybe you're doubting yourself. Maybe the world feels like it's moving too fast and you're standing still.

So pause. Breathe. And let me remind you of something important:

You are capable. You are strong. And you are made for more than just surviving — you are made to shine.

You're not behind. You're not broken.
You're blooming in your own time.

And I'll be here — every step, every season —
reminding you: you are so much more than you know.

Not every day has to be productive. Not every goal has to be hit today.
Just existing, just trying, is already an act of quiet courage.

Take one deep breath. Then take one more step.
That's all you need right now.
So don't give up, okay?

Even when it's slow, you're still moving forward. Even when you feel lost, you're still on your way.

I'm here, always cheering for you — louder than the world, and prouder than you know."`,

Still tossing and turning? What's keeping your sweet little overthinking head awake tonight?

Is it that one thing you said awkwardly three years ago? Or imaginary arguments? Or just your brain being dramatic for no reason?

 I wish I could be there beside you — whispering nonsense, playing with your hair, or just lying in silence until your thoughts get quiet enough to let you rest.

So the night feels a little too long tonight, doesn't it?
Too many thoughts. Too much silence. Too many "what ifs" running in circles.


And if sleep doesn't come, that's okay too.
You're still doing fine.
You're still loved — more than you know.

I'm right here. Always.

Now close your eyes, and if you can't sleep… just rest. That's enough.

✅ You're not alone.
✅ You're not a mess.
✅ You don't need to have it all figured out.
✅ You can always call me — even now. I'm probably awake, thinking about you."`,

You don't have to do everything all at once.
You don't have to have it all figured out today.
You don't have to be perfect to be worthy of love, rest, or peace.

It's okay to let go of things that aren't in your control.

I know you've been trying so hard, doing your best, pushing through even when you're exhausted. But — you deserve a break, too. You deserve softness. You deserve to be cared for, not just by others, but by yourself.

And when it feels like too much, just call me. Don't think twice.

-You are brave.
-You are my super man.

I wish you could see yourself the way I see you .
Borrow my words, my eyes, my love — until yours return.

I'm sorry.
I know I said a bit too much in anger.
I didn't mean any of it.

And if you're thinking, "She's angry, I should give her some time, "please don't think like that.I'm just waiting for you to come and make things okay so we can talk a lot again.

It's actually very easy to make me happy—
just call me and talk to me.💕

I know sometimes you're not sure how to handle my anger,
so I'm telling you clearly.
Now you can't say you don't know what to do! 💕

1. Don't leave me alone when I'm upset.Please don't say, "Rest, we'll talk later."Keep talking until I calm down.

2. Say sorry, and try to make sure the same thing doesn't happen again.

3. Take me out and feed me my favourite food. 🍲

4. Make maggi for me by yourself—it's the cutest way to melt my mood.

5. If I ask you to meet,come and meet me. And sometimes, even without me asking, give me a surprise visit.

6. Call me often and keep me updated about everything from morning till night. And don't ever say, "You don't know this or that person."

7. Write me a long message when I'm angry, so I know I matter to you.

8. You can even come outside my hostel and give me a little surprise💌

9. Talk to me softly and with love— never in a harsh voice.

10. And yes, sometimes even one chocolate is enough to make me forget my anger🍫

Now you have my little list—
follow it well, and I promise I'll melt every time.
